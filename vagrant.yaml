# Vagrant custom config
# main config: /puphpet/config.yaml
#
# For add vagrant to project:
#   run "git submodule add git@gitlab-int-v.globo-tech.vpn:a.tupichenkov/vagrant.git puphpet"
#   copy vagrant.yaml and Vagrantfile
#   change vagrant.yaml ip and host
#   git commit
#
# possible errors:
#   some times, when internet connection is bad, vagrant can't install some modules
#   and then vagrant will print error in command line (red coolor text):
#     The SSH command responded with a non-zero exit status. Vagrant
#     assumes that this means the command failed. The output for this command
#     should be in the log above. Please read the output to determine what
#     went wrong.
#   try run "vagrant destroy" and "vagrant up"
